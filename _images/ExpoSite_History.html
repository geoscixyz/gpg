                   Before 1902, there were wood processing and storage facilities in the area. During that period, the original shoreline was moved from the north edge of our site to the south edge using a wide variety of fill materials including wood chips, logs, and construction debris. <br>

                  </b>

                   After 1902 there was a gas manufacturing plant with storage facilities, an oil house, an auto repair garage, and a substation maintenance facility. The gas plant left some quantities of ammonia, phenolics, cyanide, oxides, and light hydrocarbons, as well as other miscellaneous waste. The substation maintenance shop included a sump in the floor into which dielectric fluids from capacitors and transformers was drained. Oil from this  sump was piped to the oil house for treatment and recycling. This oil house included large tanks, at least one of which was underground. There was also the Viaduct traffic overpass crossing over the central portion of our site, and associated support foundations may well have been left in the ground when the viaduct was later removed.<br>

                   Between 1910 and 1960 there were several different railway lines laid at various orientations across our field site.<br>

                  Sometime in 1969 or 1970 as much as several thousand gallons of oil was spilled on to the shop floor because a valve had been accidentally left open over a  weekend.<br>

                   After 1974, a fuel depot, bus wash and several underground storage tanks existed. These were demolished for the most recent use, which was a parking lot for a near by Exposition.<br>
