The GPG is a learning resource for applied geophysics and its applications to
help solve problems of relevance to society including those in resource
exploration, environmental applications, and geotechnical projects.
Geophysical surveys and data are sensitive to physical property variations in
the subsurface. These variations can be diagnostic for finding resources,
tracking contamination or mapping geologic units. Application of a geophysical
technique to help answer a geoscientific question requires that targeted
physical properties be identified and appropriate geophysical surveys,
processing and interpretation be carried out. The application of geophysics is
consolidated into a Seven Step procedure that serves as a guiding template in
every problem. In the GPG we discuss  the physical principles for each type of
survey and carry through with applications. The focus is on environmental,
resource exploration and geotechnical problems but the concepts span a broad
range of applications. The GPG is meant to be a resource for geoscientists,
including those who are not specialists in geophysics, in particular
geological engineers, geologists, and undergraduate geophysicists.  The GPG is
light on mathematical development but links to deeper levels of analysis are
provided.

To ease readers' understanding in applied geophysics and its applications,
materials in GPG are integrated with the Jupyter apps. We strongly promote readers to use both text materials in GPG and apps together.

Development of the GPG is ongoing, with the core development team consisting
of researchers and students at the University of British Columbia. We welcome
input and collaborators! Join the development on github_.
