<p>Chargeability is a physical property related to conductivity. As we learned
previously, ionic charges within a rock’s pore water begin to move under the
influence of an electric field, resulting in electrical current. However, some
of the pore ions do not move uninhibited through the rock and begin to
accumulate at impermeable boundaries. This build-up of ionic charges is
commonly referred to as induced polarization (IP), as it is responsible for
generating electric dipole moments within the rock. We use chargeability to
characterize the formation and strength of the induced polarization within a
rock, under the influence of an electric field.</p>
<p>The physical explanation for causes of chargeabilty are complex and not
completely understood. Certainly the effects are dependent upon the
microscopic nature the material and specifically upon the surface to
volume ratio of pore material and the types of fluids in the rock. The
two images below offer some insight into the complexity.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Despite the complexity are two primary phenomenological mechanisms which are
insightful in characterizing the chargeable
behaviour of rocks: membrane polarization and electrode polarization.</p>
<p><strong>Membrane Polarization</strong></p>
<p>Membrane polarization occurs when the pore space narrows to a within several
ion widths.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/memb11.gif"><img alt="../../_images/memb11.gif" src="../../_images/memb11.gif" style="width: 272.0px; height: 132.0px;" />
</a>
</figure>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Because ionic charges cannot be forced through the pore throat, they
accumulate on either side when an electric field is applied; with positive
charges accumulating on one side of the pore throat and negative charges
accumulating on the other. The accumulation of charges eventually stops
because the electric fields from the blocked charges becomes large enough
that it prevents other ions of the same sign from joining the group.</p>

</a>
</figure>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The net separation of positive and negative charges across narrow pore spaces
generates a set of electric dipole moments which is ultimately responsible for
the voltages measured in induced polarization survey.</p>

</a>
</figure>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Electrode Polarization</strong></p>
<p>Electrode polarization occurs when the pore space is blocked by metallic
particles. When an electric field is applied, the metallic particles become
electrically charged and attract nearby ions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><figure class="align-center">

</a>
</figure>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The attraction of the ions to the surface forms a primary layer of fixed ionic
charges, followed by a secondary diffuse layer of opposing charges. This is
known as an electric double layer.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Each electric double layer results in an electric dipole moment which
contributes towards the induced polarization within the rock.</p>

<h2>Effects of IP on Geophysical Measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-of-ip-on-geophysical-measurements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To demonstrate the effects of induced polarization on geophysical
measurements, consider a specific example where a current generator,
hooked to the ground as in a DC survey, is turned on.
At some location, the electric
potential (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span>) is measured. In non-chargeable rocks, an instantaneous
increase in the measured potential occurs when the source is switched
on. When the source is switched off, the current through the Earth returns
immediately to zero and
so is the measured potential. This is illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/IP_source1.gif"><img alt="../../_images/IP_source1.gif" src="../../_images/IP_source1.gif" style="width: 540.0px; height: 144.0px;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>If the ground is chargeable, there will also be an instantaneous jump in the
measured potential when the source is switched on; we denote as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_\sigma\)</span>. However, the subsequent build-up of ionic charges during the
on-time results in a corresponding increase in the measured potential; which
is sometimes referred to as the over-voltage. Eventually, the build-up of
ionic charges reaches saturation, resulting in a final measured potential
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_m\)</span>). In general, the measured potential after the source is switched
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{on}\)</span>) can be expressed as:</p>
<figure class="align-right">

</a>
</figure>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_{on}(t) = V_\sigma + V_s \Big[ 1 - e^{-t/\tau } \Big]\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_s\)</span> is the amplitude of the over-voltage and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is a
constant which determines the rate at which the induced polarization forms.</p>
<p>When the source is switched off, there is an instantaneous drop in the
measured potential equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_\sigma\)</span>. Subsequently, the accumulated
charges begin to diffuse, resulting in a measured potential which decays
according to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_{off}(t) = V_s \, e^{-t/\tau}\]</div>
<p>This decaying off-time potential is commonly called the discharge curve.
We use the discharge curve to characterize the chargeable properties of the Earth.</p>

<h3>Definitions for Chargeability<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions-for-chargeability" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It is convenient to consider “chargeabilty” as an independent physical property but
in reality it is an integral component of the electrical conductivity. It describes
how the conductivity changes with frequency. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_0\)</span> denotes the conductivity
at zero  frequency and if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_\infty\)</span> is the conductivity at infinite frequency
then the chargeability is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\eta = \frac{\sigma_\infty -\sigma_0}{\sigma_\infty}\]</div>
<p>This is a dimensionless number varying between 0 &lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta\)</span> &lt; 1. It is
often referred to as the intrinsic chargeability.  The above definition
is equivalent to defining the
intrinsic chargeability as the ratio between the amplitude of the over-voltage (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_s\)</span>)
and the DC voltage (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_m\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\eta = \frac{V_s}{V_m}\]</div>
<p>The intrinsic chargeability for materials is rarely provided in tables. Rather, numbers
based upon laboratory measurements of some characteristic of the induced polarization
response is provided. Those measurements can be in time or frequency and the units
of the “chargeability” are inherited from the data. We outline below:</p>

<h2>Two types of frequency domain data<a class="headerlink" href="#two-types-of-frequency-domain-data" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>An oscillating source current can be employed to observe chargeability. The
measurements are often still referred to as “DC resistivity” because the
frequencies are relatively low. The resulting data will include (i) a “DC
resistivity” based upon the voltages measured with the lowest source
frequency, and (ii) a chargeability based upon the measurements explained
next. Two methods of measuring chargeability in the frequency domain are
described below.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If the amplitude of the potential is measured at two frequencies, a measure
of chargeability is acquired, and it can be expressed as units of “<em>percent
frequency effect</em>” or PFE. Since the ground has less time to respond at higher
frequencies, the signal is expected to be smaller at the higher frequency.
Expressions for PFE are shown in the equations below. The data used in this
calculation are illustrated in the figure below. Recall that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_a= K

electrode geometry (see the Geophysical surveys chapter, “DC resistivity”
section), <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> is the measured potential, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> is the source
current.</p></li>

<h3>Chargeability Measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#chargeability-measurements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>For integrated and intrinsic chargeability measurements, a core sample is taken from the rock.
The core sample is then placed in a sample holder between two copper/graphite electrodes where it acts as an impedence element for a circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Chargeability Measurements</strong></p>
<p>For integrated chargeability measurements, a source is used to drive direct current (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span>) through the rock core.
During the on-time, the voltage (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_m\)</span>) is measured across the sample.
Next, the source is switched off.
During the off-time, the potential across the rock is measured as it decays.
The off-time measurements are used to define the discharge curve for the sample, which is then used to obtain the integrated chargeability according to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[M = \frac{1}{V_m} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} V_{off}(t) \, dt\]</div>
<p>For practical measurements, we do not integrate over the entire discharge curve.
Instead, a finite interval of integration is chosen.
For example, the Newmont standard chargeability integrates from t = 0.15 s to 1.1 s.</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Chargeability Measurements</strong></p>
<p>Intrinsic chargeability measurements are very similar to conductivity/resistivity measurements.
In this case, the source is used to drive alternating current (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span>) through the core sample.
By measuring the voltage drop (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V\)</span>) accross the length of the sample, Ohm’s law can be used to determine the circuit impedence (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z\)</span>) caused by the rock:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Z(\omega ) = \frac{\Delta V (\omega)}{I (\omega)}\]</div>
<p>In chargeable rocks, the measured voltage drop depends on the frequency of the alternating current.
So in order to characterize the resistive properties of the rock, we need to determine the impedence over a spectrum of frequencies.</p>
<p>The resistivity of the sample at each frequency can be obtained from the impedence, the length of the core (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>) and its cross-sectional area (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>) using Pouillet’s law:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\rho (\omega) = \frac{Z(\omega) A}{L}\]</div>
<p>In order to characterize the rock’s chargeable properties, we fit the experimentally acquired resistivity values to a mathematical model (illstrated below).
A well-established model for explaining the resistivities of chargeable rocks is the Cole-Cole model:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\rho (\omega) = \rho_0 \Bigg [ 1 - \eta \Bigg ( 1 - \frac{1}{1 + (i\omega\tau )^C} \Bigg ) \Bigg ]\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_0\)</span> is the DC resistivity and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta\)</span> is the intrinsic chargeability.
Parameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> define the rate at which ionic charges accumulate when an electric field is applied.</p>

<p>Assuming <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C=1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> defines the exponential decay in voltage during the off-time measurements (see earlier).
The conductivity of the rock can be obtained by taking the reciprocal of the complex resistivity:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sigma (\omega) = \frac{1}{\rho (\omega)}\]</div>
<p>Additionally, Ohm’s law still applies for chargeable rocks.
Thus:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\vec J (\omega) = \sigma (\omega) \vec E (\omega)\]</div>

<h3>Chargeabilities of Common Rocks<a class="headerlink" href="#chargeabilities-of-common-rocks" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Tables (from Telford et al, 1976) provide a very general guide to the
integrated chargeabilities of materials. Because different intervals of
integration <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([t_1,t_2]\)</span> are used for each table, chargeability values
cannot be compared between tables. However, we can infer several things from
these tables:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The individual properties of rocks results in a variation in chargeability (click <a class="reference internal" href="tables/chargeability_sulphide_rocks.html#table-chargeability-rocks"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> for table).</p></li>
<li><p>Chargeability increases as the % abundance of sulphide minerals increases (click <a class="reference internal" href="tables/chargeability_sulphide_percent.html#table-chargeability-sulphide"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> for table).</p></li>
<li><p>Highly porous rocks such as extrusive volcanics and sandstones are more chargeable than hard rocks such as granites and limestones (click <a class="reference internal" href="tables/chargeability_sulphide_percent.html#table-chargeability-sulphide"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> for table).</p></li>
<li><p>The type of ore-mineralization impacts the chargeability of rocks to varying degrees (click <a class="reference internal" href="tables/chargeability_sulphide_minerals.html#table-chargeability-minerals"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> for table).</p></li>

<h3>Factors Impacting Chargeability<a class="headerlink" href="#factors-impacting-chargeability" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Sulphide Mineralization:</strong></p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, electrode polarization occurs when the pore path is blocked by metallic particles.
A major source of these metallic particles is sulphide mineralization.
As the abundance of sulphide minerals within a rock increases, so does the electrode polarization.
Therefore, highly mineralized rock tend to be very chargeable.</p>
<p><strong>Clays:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><figure class="align-right">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/memb_pol_2nd_type1.gif"><img alt="../../_images/memb_pol_2nd_type1.gif" src="../../_images/memb_pol_2nd_type1.gif" style="width: 350.0px; height: 288.0px;" />
</a>
</figure>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Clays have a tendancy to partially block the path which ions take through the rock’s pore water.
Upon application of an electric potential, positive charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate.
This results in an “ion-selective” membrane polarization.
Clays represent a dominant source of induced polarization in unmineralized sedimentary rocks.</p>
<p>A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane, while a deficiency occurs at the other end.
The reduction of mobility is most obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions between adjacent membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz. Conductivity increases at higher frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>Pore-Water Salinity:</strong></p>
<p>The induced polarization within a rock depends on having a mechanism for accumulating ionic charges.
It also depends on the salinity of the pore water; i.e. the concentration of ions within the pore water.
As the pore-water salinity increases, so does the capacity of the rock to support a build-up of ionic charges.
This results in an increases chargeability for the rock.</p>
<p><strong>Tortuosity:</strong></p>
<p>Tortuosity defines the connectivity and complexity of a rock’s pore-space network.
As the tortuosity of the rock’s pore-space increases, it becomes more difficult for ionic charges to move through the rock.
As a result, and increases abundance of ionic charges will accumulate within the rock when it is subjected to an electric field.
Thus, the chargeability of a rock increases and its tortuosity increases.</p>
