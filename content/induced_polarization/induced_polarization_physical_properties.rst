Chargeability
*************

Chargeability is a physical property related to conductivity. As we learned
previously, ionic charges within a rock's pore water begin to move under the
influence of an electric field, resulting in electrical current. However, some
of the pore ions do not move uninhibited through the rock and begin to
accumulate at impermeable boundaries. This build-up of ionic charges is
commonly referred to as induced polarization (IP), as it is responsible for
generating electric dipole moments within the rock. We use chargeability to
characterize the formation and strength of the induced polarization within a
rock, under the influence of an electric field.

The physical explanation for causes of chargeabilty are complex and not
completely understood. Certainly the effects are dependent upon the
microscopic nature the material and specifically upon the surface to
volume ratio of pore material and the types of fluids in the rock. The
two images below offer some insight into the complexity.

Despite the complexity are two primary phenomenological mechanisms which are
insightful in characterizing the chargeable
behaviour of rocks: membrane polarization and electrode polarization.

**Membrane Polarization**

Membrane polarization occurs when the pore space narrows to a within several
ion widths.


 .. figure:: ./images/memb1.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 %


Because ionic charges cannot be forced through the pore throat, they
accumulate on either side when an electric field is applied; with positive
charges accumulating on one side of the pore throat and negative charges
accumulating on the other. The accumulation of charges eventually stops
because the electric fields from the blocked charges becomes large enough
that it prevents other ions of the same sign from joining the group.


 .. figure:: ./images/memb2.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 %



The net separation of positive and negative charges across narrow pore spaces
generates a set of electric dipole moments which is ultimately responsible for
the voltages measured in induced polarization survey.

    :scale: 100 %



**Electrode Polarization**

Electrode polarization occurs when the pore space is blocked by metallic
particles. When an electric field is applied, the metallic particles become
electrically charged and attract nearby ions.

    :align: center
    :scale: 100


The attraction of the ions to the surface forms a primary layer of fixed ionic
charges, followed by a secondary diffuse layer of opposing charges. This is
known as an electric double layer.


 .. figure:: ./images/elec_pol_3.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 100


Each electric double layer results in an electric dipole moment which
contributes towards the induced polarization within the rock.

Chargeabilities of Common Rocks
===============================

Tables (from Telford et al, 1976) provide a very general guide to the
integrated chargeabilities of materials. Because different intervals of
integration :math:`[t_1,t_2]` are used for each table, chargeability values
cannot be compared between tables. However, we can infer several things from
these tables:


- The individual properties of rocks results in a variation in chargeability (click :ref:`here<table_chargeability_rocks>` for table).
- Chargeability increases as the % abundance of sulphide minerals increases (click :ref:`here<table_chargeability_sulphide>` for table).
- Highly porous rocks such as extrusive volcanics and sandstones are more chargeable than hard rocks such as granites and limestones (click :ref:`here<table_chargeability_sulphide>` for table).
- The type of ore-mineralization impacts the chargeability of rocks to varying degrees (click :ref:`here<table_chargeability_minerals>` for table).



Factors Impacting Chargeability
===============================


**Sulphide Mineralization:**

As we discussed earlier, electrode polarization occurs when the pore path is blocked by metallic particles.
A major source of these metallic particles is sulphide mineralization.
As the abundance of sulphide minerals within a rock increases, so does the electrode polarization.
Therefore, highly mineralized rock tend to be very chargeable.


**Clays:**

 .. figure:: ./images/memb_pol_2nd_type.gif
    :align: right
    :scale: 100

Clays have a tendancy to partially block the path which ions take through the rock's pore water.
Upon application of an electric potential, positive charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate.
This results in an "ion-selective" membrane polarization.
Clays represent a dominant source of induced polarization in unmineralized sedimentary rocks.

A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane, while a deficiency occurs at the other end.
The reduction of mobility is most obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions between adjacent membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz. Conductivity increases at higher frequencies.


**Pore-Water Salinity:**


The induced polarization within a rock depends on having a mechanism for accumulating ionic charges.
It also depends on the salinity of the pore water; i.e. the concentration of ions within the pore water.
As the pore-water salinity increases, so does the capacity of the rock to support a build-up of ionic charges.
This results in an increases chargeability for the rock.


**Tortuosity:**

Tortuosity defines the connectivity and complexity of a rock's pore-space network.
As the tortuosity of the rock's pore-space increases, it becomes more difficult for ionic charges to move through the rock.
As a result, and increases abundance of ionic charges will accumulate within the rock when it is subjected to an electric field.
Thus, the chargeability of a rock increases and its tortuosity increases.

.. Introduction
.. ============

.. Chargeability is a physical property that is related to resistivity. The
.. module about DC resistivity shows that potentials measured in a DC resistivity
.. survey can be related to charges that accumulate when current is made to flow.
.. However, when the transmitter current is switched off, the measured voltage
.. may take up to several seconds to reach zero. Similarly, when the current is
.. switched on, there may be a finite time taken for the voltage to reach a
.. steady state value. In other words, current injected into the ground causes
.. some materials to become polarized. The phenomenon is called induced
.. polarization, and the physical property that is measured is usually called
.. chargeability, which quantifies the material's capacity to retain charges
.. after a forcing current is removed. The following figure illustrates the
.. measurable effect.

..  .. figure:: ./images/IP_source.gif
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100 %


.. Induced polarization can also be measured using low frequency sinusoidal
.. signals, as discussed in the `induced polarization measurements data`_ section
.. of this chapter. The signals or data that are measured depend upon which of
.. the various types of source signals are used. Note that IP surveys always
.. include resistivity measurements because the electrical resistivity of teh
.. earth must be known in order to invert data to recover chargeability.



.. What can be detected?
.. =====================

.. The materials that are most chargeable include sulfide minerals (both massive
.. and disseminated), clay-rich materials, and graphite. However, the
.. chargeablility of materials can have a wide range within the same geographic
.. region. This is because chargeability depends upon many factors, including
.. mineral type, grain size, the ratio of internal surface area to volume, the
.. properties of electrolytes in pore space, and the physics of interaction
.. between surfaces and fluids.

.. Interpretation of chargeabililty models is further complicated by the fact
.. that there is no standard set of units for this physical property. There are
.. at least three ways of measuring the phenomenon and models recovered by
.. inversion generally take on the same units as the measurement. This could be
.. milli-seconds if measurements are made of the ground's response to impulsive
.. sources. The units could also be percent if the response at two or more source
.. signal frequencies is compared, or units of milliradians may be used if the
.. phase difference between source and received signals is recorded.

.. Physical Phenomenons
.. ====================

.. .. _induced polarization measurements data: http://gpg.geosci.xyz/en/latest/content/induced_polarization/induced_polarization_measurements_data.html

.. The chargeability of earth materials is essentially an electrochemical effect
.. caused by many factors, not all of which are completely understood. If ground
.. is chargeable, it responds as if resistivity was a complex quantity - it
.. behaves somewhat like a leaky capacitor. Therefore the chargeability can be
.. measured in a number of ways using time domain or frequency domain techniques
.. (detailed in the section `induced polarization measurements data`_). Aspects
.. affecting the chargeability of a sample include:

..  - the grain size of particles in the sample;
..  - the type and mobility of ions within the pore fluids;
..  - the details of microscopic interactions between solid surfaces and fluids;
..  - the amount of surface area within a specific volume.

.. The surface area-to-volume ratio is an important factor. Clays tend to be
.. chargeable while sandstones are not, and the images here illustrate one reason
.. why this is true. In addition, the surface interactions between clay minerals
.. and fluids enhance the ability of these materials to hold charges.

.. Two microscopic effects cause macroscopic chargeability
.. -------------------------------------------------------

.. There are two primary causes of chargeability. In both cases the re-
.. distribution of charges takes some time to occur when an external DC electric
.. field is applied. Equivalently, it takes the same time to revert to a balanced
.. charge distribution once the electric field is removed. "Charging" is hard to
.. measure in practice. "Discharging" is measured using time domain IP survey
.. techniques. The effect of finite charging time on sinusoidal signals at
.. different frequencies also can be measured using frequency domain or phase IP
.. surveys. The two types of polarization are called "membrane polarization" and
.. "electrode polarization."

.. Membrane polarization
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Membrane polarization occurs when pore space narrows to within several
.. boundary layer thicknesses (which is the thickness of ions adsorbed to a
.. surface).

..  .. figure:: ./images/memb1.gif
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100 %

.. Charges cannot flow easily, so they accumulate when an electric field is applied.

..  .. figure:: ./images/memb2.gif
..     :figclass: center
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100 %


.. The result is a net charge dipole which adds to any other voltages measured at
.. the surface.

..  .. figure:: ./images/memb3.gif
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100 %

.. A second form of membrane polarization is similar to the first:

..  .. figure:: ./images/memb_pol_2nd_type.gif
..     :align: right
..     :scale: 100

.. This occurs where clay particles partially block ionic solution paths, as in
.. the adjacent figure. Upon application of an electric potential, positive
.. charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate. There is an
.. "ion-selective membrane."

.. A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane, while
.. a deficiency occurs at the other end. The reduction of mobility is most
.. obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions between adjacent
.. membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz. Conductivity increases at
.. higher frequencies.

.. Electrode polarization
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Electrode polarization occurs when pore space is blocked by metallic
.. particles. Again, charges accumulate when an electric field is applied.

..  .. figure:: ./images/elec_pol_1.gif
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100

.. The result is two electrical double layers which add to voltages measured at
.. the surface.

..  .. figure:: ./images/elec_pol_2.gif
..     :align: center
..     :scale: 100

.. Comments on electrode polarization
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  .. figure:: ./images/elec_pol_3.gif
..     :align: right
..     :scale: 100

.. Some remarks are appropriate here in order to provide some sense of the
.. complexity of the chargeability phenomenon.

.. At an interface between ionic and metallic conduction (for example, an ore
.. grain in pore water), there is an impedance involved in getting current to
.. flow across the barrier. These interfaces look like the top figure and have
.. the simplified circuit analogue shown in the bottom figure.

..  .. figure:: ./images/elec_pol_4.gif
..     :align: right
..     :scale: 100 %

.. Current can flow via charge transfer (or ion diffusion), which involves
.. electrochemical processes, or via a capacitive effect (no charge transfer),
.. involving diffusion currents.

.. Ion diffusion is not easy to model with circuit elements. The process is
.. called the Warburg impedance. Its magnitude varies as approximately
.. 1/frequency.

.. Note that, while it is useful to understand simplified models of the relevant
.. electrical behaviour of surface-electrolyte interactions, all rocks are, in
.. fact, "dirty" in the sense that they are not simply pure "electrodes"
.. (semiconducting mineral grains) and electrolytes (pore solutions).  There are
.. other materials and particles affecting ionic behaviour within and outside the
.. diffuse layer, and some of the sample's constituents will affect the behaviour
.. of the fixed layer near and on the liquid-solid interfaces.

.. Summary of what affects the chargeability of material
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..     - Induced polarization is greater when there are larger regions of adsorbed anomalous charge (adjacent to an interface); i.e. when there is a large surface area-to-volume ratio.
..     - Non-ionic fluids (such as contaminants) can markedly change the behaviour of surface-electrolyte interactions.
..     - Changes in ion concentration (such as increased salinity) will also affect both types of polarization.
..     - Both effects (membrane and electrode polarization) are related to grain size as much as material type. Therefore, discrimination of mineral type on the basis of chargeability alone is not recommended.

.. Spectral Induced Polarization
.. =============================

..  .. figure:: ./images/spectral_ip.gif
..     :align: right
..     :scale: 100 %

.. The Cole-Cole model for complex impedance is often used for modeling the
.. ground's impedance. The Cole-Cole model is written as:

..  .. math::
..         \rho (\omega) = \rho_0 \left[1-m \left( 1- \frac{1}{1+(j \omega \tau)^c}\right) \right]

.. This relation describes a complex impedance as a function of frequency,
.. :math:`\omega` with three parameters. :math:`m` is intrinsic chargeability,
.. :math:`\tau` is a time constant (of the decay curve), and :math:`c` is a
.. parameter controlling the frequency dependence.

.. Typical chargeabilities for materials
.. =====================================

.. The following tables (from Telford et al, 1976) provides a very general guide
.. to possible chargeabilities of materials. One reason that in-situ
.. chargeabilities tend to appear lower than laboratory values is that large
.. volumes of mixed materials are involved in field measurements.

.. These examples show that a wide range of variability can be expected, implying
.. that it is difficult to use values of intrinsic chargeability (in models
.. obtained by inversion of IP data) to determine exactly what type of rock or
.. material is in the ground. However, this is an ongoing topic of research.

.. **Table 1:** Charging and integration times were about 1 minute each, which is
.. much longer than field survey systems; therefore, values are larger than
.. field measurements.

.. Typical problems where chargeability is useful
.. ==============================================


.. Mineral exploration for sulfides (disseminated and massive) is unquestionably
.. the most common application of IP because those types of ore minerals are
.. often chargeable.There are also applications in hydrogeology. For example,
.. mapping salt water intrusions in aquifers that include clayey layers may be
.. difficult using resistivity alone. However, the increased chargeability
.. associated with clay may help differentiate between zones with more saline
.. water and clay, both of which have low resistivity. In addition, there is a

.. detection and delineation of contaminants in the ground. There has also been
.. some effort to apply IP to oil and gas exploration.
