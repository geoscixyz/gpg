Susceptibility
==============

The magnetic susceptibility (:math:`\kappa`) defines how easily a rock becomes magnetized when it is subjected to a magnetic field :math:`\mathbf{H}`. The relationship is:

.. math:: \mathbf{M}=\kappa \mathbf{H}.

Background information about susceptility, how it is measured and tables of values are provided in :ref:`magnetic susceptibility<physprop_mag_susc>`.  In a geological context, :ref:`magnetite-rich rocks<physprop_susc_common_rocks>` are the main source of magnetic signal, both in terms of abundance and susceptibility. In engineering, buried metallic objects are generally highly susceptible, but they can also carry a substantial :ref:`remanent<magnetics_remanent>` component. The image below shows a rock that has a remanent component that it is strong enough for the rock to act as a magnetic and attract some paper clips, just as a bar magnet does.
