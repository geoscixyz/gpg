Processing
**********

This section focusses on the the temporal and spatial correction of magnetic data prior to the interpretation phase. In most cases, these processing steps are completed by the acquisition team, providing both the raw and processed data as a final product.

Removal of time variations
==========================

Earth's magnetic field changes over time for a variety of :ref:`reasons<magnetics_external_sources>`. If the changes in earth's
field have an amplitude that is significant compared to our anomalous signal,
then we need to correct for the observed temporal variations. The general
procedure  is to establish a :ref:`base-station<magnetics_base_station>` which is fixed in location and
continually measures  the magnetic field. Each datum acquired by the roving
sensor is also time-stamped. The assumption  is then made that the changes in
the Earth's magnetic field caused by these natural sources have a long enough
spatial wavelength that they are same at any point on the survey grid.  Field
data, corrected for these time variations, is obtained through the following
subtraction process

.. math::
	\Delta \textbf{B}(t) = \textbf{B}_{obs}(t) - \textbf{B}_{base}(t)

The Geological Survey of Canada geomag_ page can provide graphs of
diurnal variations observed at any of 11 magnetic observatories in Canada, for
any day in the most recent 3 years.

.. _magnetics_regional_trend:

Removal of regional trends
==========================

In order to interpret magnetic data in terms of features and structures at
depth, the anomalous field caused by buried features of interest must be
isolated. In other words, we must try to remove the contribution to the
measurements made by the earth's field and also from geologic features larger
than the actual survey area. That is, we want to remove a regional field. If
we designate magnetic fields as **B**, then we want to perform the following

.. math::
	\textbf{B}_{a} = \Delta \textbf{B} - \textbf{B}_{regional}

Estimates of the regional field may be obtained using:

- the :ref:`IGRF<magnetics_IGRF>`

- a constant value selected by the interpreter (when survey areas are small);

- a more sophisticated polynomial (map) generated by a computer using least
  squares (or other) analysis of data;

- it is also possible to use inversion at a large scale to define a regional
  field.

To illustrate the process, when data are collected along a line, the removal
of a regional trend can be managed graphically, as shown here:

.. figure:: ./images/regional.gif
	:align: center
	:scale: 110%

Clearly this process involves some degree of subjectivity and will depend upon
how you draw a line that separates the desired "signal" from the background.
The situation becomes more complicated for  magnetic maps (data collected over
an area) where the causative bodies have complicated shapes and variable
dimensions. Nevertheless, removing an approximate regional field can be of
critical importance in isolating an anomaly for further processing as maps or
input into an inversion. The following is an example showing the regional
magnetic map and a local anomalous field taken from a survey in central
British Columbia. The area is Mt. Milligan, which has recently opened up as a
mine. In the large-scale map the dominant feature is the magnetic signature of
the mountain. Of interest is a (2km x 2km) segment of that map. A large-scale
regional field is estimated, subtracted from the observed data, and the
results are shown in a second  window. The magnetic feature observed in that
map is related to the ore body.

Reduction to Pole
=================

Reduction to pole is a processing step which allows for easier interpretation of magnetic data. During a reduction to pole, the observed data are used to compute the magnetic anomaly that would have been measured if the Earth's field had been vertical (90 :math:`\!\,^o` inclination).

The magnetic anomalies from susceptible bodies depend significantly on the inclination and declination of the Earth's magnetic field; see :numref:`fig_reduce_to_pole_1`. As a result, it may be challenging to resolve the location/orientation of a susceptible body solely by examining the anomaly it produces. In :numref:`fig_reduce_to_pole_1` b, we see that the location of maximum anomaly amplitude is offset from the location of the steel pipe. However, the location of the pipe and the maximum anomaly amplitude are the same when the inclination is 90 :math:`\!\,^o`; this is the case for most susceptible bodies. For an inclination of 90 :math:`\!\,^o`, it is also easier to determine if the object is elongated or dipping.

  Magnetic anomaly from a vertically orientation 2 m pole for differing inclinations of the Earth's field: a) 90 :math:`\!\,^o`, b) 45 :math:`\!\,^o` and c) 0 :math:`\!\,^o`.


To demonstrate the effectiveness of reduction to pole, let us consider a magnetic UXO survey (:numref:`fig_reduce_to_pole_2`). On the left, we see the total magnetic field data collected at the survey site. Although anomalies indicate the presence of a number of potential targets, the location of each object relative to the anomaly it produces is inconsistent. However after completing a reduction to pole (right), the location of each potential targets becomes easily visible.
