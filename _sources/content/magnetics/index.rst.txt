Measurements of the magnetic field contain information about subsurface
variations in **magnetic susceptibility**. Data can
be acquired in the air (planes, satellites), on the ground (stationary, moving
platforms, marine) and underground (boreholes, tunnels). The measurements record the sum of
Earth's field and fields induced in magnetic materials. More magnetic (i.e.
susceptible) materials have stronger induced fields. Removing Earth's field
from the observations yields anomalous fields that can be interpreted in terms
of where magnetic material lies and also its susceptiblity and shape. Processed data are
presented as maps or profiles, and advanced processing, involving inversion,
yields parametric structures or 3D models of the subsurface susceptibility
distribution.  Magnetic surveying is extremely versatile and can be applied in many
areas in the geosciences including geologic mapping, mineral exploration,
unexploded ordnance detection, and archeology.

.. This section covers some basic information for magnetic surveys. The physical
.. property of concern is magnetic susceptibility, which is a measure of how
.. magnetized a material becomes in the presence of a magnetic field. The source
.. for a magnetic  survey is the natural magnetic field of the earth. Receivers
.. measure either the amplitude of the magnetic field or one or more of its
.. components. The earth's field changes with latitude and longitude and hence
.. magnetic surveys, carried out over the same  geologic structure or buried
.. object, will generate different data at different locations on the earth. In
.. this module we present basic material for understanding the magnetic survey,
.. how the data are processed and how they can be interpreted.
