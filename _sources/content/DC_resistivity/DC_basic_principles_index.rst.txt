Basic principles
****************

This Section presents the important physical principles upon which DC
resistivity methods are based. The relations between current flow, potentials
and resistivity in uniform ground are explained. This forms the basis for the
concept of apparent resistivity derived from practical survey arrangements
(two current and two potential electrodes planted at the surface). The effect
of anisotropic ground upon measured potentials is then described. Finally,
charge distribution is explained because it is a useful way of understanding
how potentials arise at the surface due to variations in electrical
conductivity underground. The forward modeling relations are also based upon
charge distribution.
