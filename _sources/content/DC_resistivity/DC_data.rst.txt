Introduction
============

For DC resistivity surveys, the energy source is a generator which injects a
constant current into the ground using two electrodes. The "signals out"
(data) are voltages measured at various places on the surface, along with
strength of the known current source (in Amperes) and details about relative
geometry of the four electrodes.

In order to create maps or graphs of raw data for quality assessment or for
direct interpretations, measurements are converted into a form that is related
to the relevant physical property. For each measurement, a 3D version of Ohm's
Law is used to generate a datum with units of resistivity (or conductivity).
These transformed data are called **apparent resistivities** because they
represent the earth's true resistivity only if the ground is uniform. When
subsurface resistivity varies, interpretation must be based upon the way in
which apparent resistivity varies as a function of electrode geometry and
position. The commonly used survey procedures are explained later on this
page, after discussions about current flow, sources, measurements, and
conversion to apparent resistivities.


Apparent resistivity
====================

If there are two current (source) electrodes, the potential is the
superposition of the effects from both. In a practical experiment (figure
below), one electrode, :math:`A`, is the positive side of a current source, and
the other electrode, :math:`B`, is the negative side. The current into each
electrode is equal, but of opposite sign. For a practical survey, we need two
electrodes to measure a potential difference. These are :math:`M`, the positive
terminal of the voltmeter (the one closest to the :math:`A` current electrode),
and :math:`N`, the negative terminal of the voltmeter.

The measured voltage is a potential difference :math:`(V_M - V_N)` in which each
potential is the superposition of the effects from both current sources:

.. math::
	\Delta V &= V_M - V_N \textrm{, with} \\[0.8em]
	V_M &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AM}}  -  \frac{1}{r_{BM}} \right \} \textrm{ and}  \\[0.8em]
	V_N &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AN}}  -  \frac{1}{r_{BN}} \right \} \textrm{, so} \\[0.8em]
	\Delta V &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AM}} - \frac{1}{r_{BM}} - \frac{1}{r_{AN}} + \frac{1}{r_{BN}}  	 \right \}\\[0.8em]
	\Delta V &=I \rho G

In the final relation, :math:`G` is a geometric factor which depends upon the
geometry of all four electrodes. Finally, we can define apparent resistivity
(discussed in the measurements section) by rearranging the last expression to
give:

.. math::
   \rho_a = \frac{\Delta V}{IG}

Similarly, the apparent conductivity is

.. math::
   \sigma_a = \frac{1}{\rho_a} = \frac{IG}{\Delta V}


We use the term *apparent resistivity* :math:`\rho_{a}` because it is the true resistivity
of materials only if the Earth is a uniform halfspace within range of the
survey. Otherwise, this number represents some complicated averaging of the
resistivities of all materials encountered by the current field.


For any survey we can compute the apparent resistivity if measured voltage,
:math:`I`, and the geometric factor, :math:`G` are known. Sometimes there is a
simple expression for :math:`G`. For example, if electrodes are spaced equally
by a distance :math:`a`, then:

 .. math::
		G = \frac{ \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{2a}	 - \frac{1}{2a} + \frac{1}{a} }{2 \pi}	= \frac{1}{2 \pi a}

This is the case for the "Wenner" array shown in :numref:`Survey Configuration`, which summarizes
the geometric factor for a variety of common electrode configurations. Note
that in this figure, :math:`k=1/G` . Usage of the various arrays is illustrated
in the next section.

Plotting raw data
=================

How are apparent resistivities (calculated from measured potentials, currents
and geometries) displayed for direct interpretation or for quality assessment?
There is one conventional plotting scheme for soundings, while plotting of
profiles depends upon the survey configuration.


Soundings
---------

Soundings are used when the earth's electrical structure needs to be
interpreted in terms of layers under a single location at the surface. The
electrode spacings are varied symmetrically about a central location.

Profiling
---------

 .. figure:: ./images/Pseudo_PDP_East.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 100 % 

Simple profiling involves moving a fixed array of four electrodes along a
survey line. If there are no changes of spacing, then a simple graph of
apparent resistivity versus line position would be adequate. A contour plot
could be created if there is suitable coverage of the area.

**Pseudosections:** When profiling, potentials are usually measured at several
positions for every current source location. Results at wider separations
between the potential pair and the transmitter pair provide some information
about deeper structures. The conventional method of plotting such results is
the pseudosection, so called because it is not a true geological cross-
section. Values of apparent resistivity are plotted on the graph as shown in
Figures 9 and 10. The vertical axis represents separation distance, NOT
depth. When all values are plotted, the result is contoured. Interpretation
is tricky and requires some experience.

	electrodes are spaced a meters apart (same for potential electrodes), and
	current-voltage separation is n√óa meters (n is an integer).

In the animation in Figure 10, the process of gathering and plotting profiling
data is illustrated. The survey illustrated involves a dipole-dipole array
with :math:`a = 2` meters, and :math:`n = 4`.

**Gradient array:** Large scale reconnaissance surveys are sometimes done using
the gradient array (Figure 7e above). If the current sources are not moved,
then the energizing field is the same for all measurements. There is,
therefore, no inherent information about variations with depth, just like
the case of gravity and magnetic surveys. Gradient array surveys are often
displayed simply by contour plotting the results.

**Real Sections:** There is one variation of the gradient array that provides
limited information about structures at depth. It is run under the trade
name "real-section," but the plot is still a "pseudosection" because
apparent resistivity data are plotted with no attempt to convert apparent
(measured) resistivities into true (intrinsic) resistivities. In the
following figures, red electrodes are the current source, and blue
electrodes are the potential measurement electrodes. A row of potential
measurements at fixed "a" spacing is gathered for each pair of current
electrode placements. This is basically a set of seven (in this case)
gradient surveys along the same line. At four stages in acquisition, the
data look like the following:

**Choice of array:** Does the choice of array type matter for profiling?
Appendix II has a brief comparison of pseudosections and the results of
inverting data gathered using the arrays.

.. appendix II is not included in the current version and therefore the preceding line needs to be modified.

Processing options
==================

Very little processing is applied to most raw resistivity data, other than to
convert from apparent resistivities to potentials if that is needed for input
to inversion programs. This is accomplished by using the apparent resistivity
formula for the array in use, and the known geometric factor. If the current,
:math:`I`, is taken to be 1 (even if it was not 1 Amp in the field), then the
result is a normalized potential in units of volts.
