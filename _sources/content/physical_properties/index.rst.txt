Physical Properties
*******************

In geophysics, materials are differentiated based on their physical properties. Physical properties characterize how materials respond to various physical inputs. For example, if I send sound waves through this material, how quickly does the signal propagate? How effective is this material at conducting electricity? Can I magnetize this material by applying a magnetic field? Sufficient understanding of material physical properties is ultimately paramount, as this information can be used to choose the optimum survey method for a given geophysical/geotechnical/geological problem.

As part of the GPG, we will focus on the following physical properties: :ref:`density<physical_properties_density>`, :ref:`magnetic susceptibility and permeability<physprop_mag_susc>`, :ref:`seismic velocity<seismic_velocity_duplicate>`, :ref:`dielectric permittivity<physical_properties_dielectric_permittivity>`, :ref:`electrical conductivity/resistivity<physical_properties_conductivity>` and :ref:`chargeability<induced_polarization_physical_properties_duplicate>`. For each physical property:

	- Relevant quantities are defined.
	- We explain how the physical property can be measured.
	- Physics associated with the physical property are explained.
	- A common range of values for rocks and materials is provided.
	- Factors impacting the physical property are explained.
