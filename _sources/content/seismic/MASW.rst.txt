MASW
====================

MASW is an initialism that stands for multichannel analysis of surface waves. It is a seismic surveying technique that uses surface waves to study the propagation of shear waves in the subsurface. Compared to the refraction and reflection techniques, it is quite new and has been mainly used for geotechnical work. For more information on the MASW technique please see
