Reflection
**********

In reflection seismology we record seismic pulses that are reflected from
boundaries which separate layers that have different acoustic impedances.
Unlike in refraction surveying, information in the seismogram which comes
after the first arrival is important. In general the processing is
considerably different than in refraction surveying.


In reflection seismology, seismic records from many sets of shots and
receivers are used to generate a Normal Incidence Reflection Seismogram which
has reflections that correspond to a vertically traveling wave. The
reflections occur at travel times that are determined by the velocity and the
length of the travel path in each layer. The normal incidence reflection
seismograms are acquired at regular distances along the surface and are
composited into a seismic section. This generates an image of the substructure
that can be used in an identical manner to a radar section.

In order to benefit from gathering several echoes from each reflecting point
there are numerous operations that need to be applied to the data. Much of the
data processing is tied to the hypothesis that the earth's properties vary
most strongly in the vertical direction. The following points illustrate the
fundamental procedural concept underlying the creation of a final seismic
reflection section:
