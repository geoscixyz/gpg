**Objective:** We want to image reflections across layers where there is an impedance change.

**Reason for using many "redundant" echoes--to reduce noise:** We need to gather several versions of the experiment and stack.

**Logistics:** However, surveying with one shot and many geophones is more cost-effective.

**Therefore** Field work must be arranged as follows:

1. We gather data using the geometry of type (3). Data from one shot into many
   geophones ("common shot data") are shown below under the label Shot Record 14.

2. Next, sort these "common shot data" so that traces appear as if gathered
   using the geometry of type (2). All traces that reflected under one location
   are collected into a "common mid point gather", one from each of many common
   shot data sets. (See the panel under CMP loc. 27.)

3. Stack these traces to produce one trace which represents measurements
   obtained using the desired geometry of type (1). This is the CMP (common mid
   point) trace. This will require a "move-out" correction to be applied.

4. Then many of these CMP traces are combined into one cross section of the
   earth's structure. Traces are labeled **CMP number**, and the one trace shown
   is identified with arrows.

5. Interpretation in terms of geology is the final step. The procedures to
   accomplish these steps will be explained in subsequent pages of the notes.
