In this section we look at Induced Polarization (IP) surveys. IP surveys are
often linked to DC surveys, and the sources and receivers for IP surveys are
the same. The physical property for IP surveys is chargeabilityâ€”a measure of
how well material holds charge. There are four types of data that are obtained
from these surveys, two in the time domain and two in the frequency domain.
Likewise, there are different ways to quantify chargeability, so pay close
attention to units. We will also look into the essential equations that go
into forward modelling IP data.
